# Requirements
## Introduction
Airline Reservation System(ARS) is one of the basic essentials in the sector of Aviation. ARS are the application which are part of Passenger services where the application supports the customers by enabling ticketing services to them at their convinience rather that spending lots of time by standing in queue in order to book a ticket.
Airline reservation systems incorporate airline schedules, fare tariffs, passenger reservations and ticket records. An airline's direct distribution works within their own reservation system, as well as pushing out information to the GDS(Global Distribution System).
Putting all that in mind I have chosen this particular topic in order solve the problem using some innovative methods where it also provides me a coppurtunity to upskill my C programming skills as well as apply SDLC Concepts.

# Benefits

ARS offer a range of benefits, here are just a few of them:

1.Easy to book tickets

2.Saves time and money

3.Send automated tickets to the customer by mail

4.Easy cancellation and Refund Policies

## SWOT ANALYSIS
![SWOT-Sample](https://github.com/adarishashank/AppliedSDLC/blob/main/1_Requirements/SWOT.png)

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:

For small to large travel and ticket agencies.

## What:

Many travel and ticket agencies that are not able to afford high ARS Management Systems. Without log in page agencies can easily reserve or cancel their customers booking.

## When:

In 1978, due to the economy and the emergence of new types of jets, government stopped controlling fares, prices, and routes, as well as market entry. That made the airline industry a free market new players could enter while existing carriers now could set their own prices and establish new routes.Seeing the opportunities, airlines started to share CRSs with non-competing carriers, opening access to multiple airlineâ€™s inventories via a single terminal. Carriers that participated in distribution through CRS had to pay a commission to be available through the platform. Those events in the market led to the emergence of a new term: Global Distribution System or GDS.Airlines now gained over 60 percent of bookings from travel and ticket agencies.

## Where:

This system is accepted Internationally.

## How:

Without ARS customers had to wait in line for seat reservation. ARS has improved the management of seat reservation/cancellation and maintaining the records.Airline Reservation System shoots up the sales of an airline company and gives a competitive edge.One of the primary reason for choosing airline reservation system is to increase the number of bookings of the flight ticket.
